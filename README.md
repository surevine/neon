====

An in-progress project to enhance common enterprise tools such as Gitlab, Nexus and Jive, with engaging developer community features

This project is in a very Alpha stage and currently being written with a single use-case in mind.  Unless you know exactly what you're doing (ie. you're working on the project) you're strongly advised not to use it, as it probably doesn't work yet.

Move along folks, nothing to see here :-)
